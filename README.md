## Problem definition

Agrawal and Sholl (2019) show that appropriate consideration of framework flexibility may be important to quantitative predictions about molecular adsorption in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). However, taking the framework flexibility into account directly in the molecular simulation framework may be 5-10 times morecomputationally expensive than standard simulation methods based on rigid crystal structure. Therefore, we are interested in constructing a machine learning model to predict the adsorption properties of MOFs with framework flexibility based on: (1) the features of the MOFs, (2) the features of adsorbants, and (3) the adsorption properties from standard simulation methods based on rigid crystal structure.

## Dataset details

The dataset is in the `data` folder.
It is composed of three parts:
1. **36 MOF features** (under `data/ML_data`)
2. **6 adsorbant features** (manually added in `data_input.ipynb`)
3. **adsorption uptakes** of **882 (MOF, adsorbant) pairs** (under `data/flexibility_data/y_data/adsorption_data`), containing two values:
    1. values from rigid model
    2. mean values from flexible model

The data has been preliminary processed in `data_input.ipynb`.

## Model training strategy

1. Multi-linear regression
2. Kernel regression
3. Kernel ridge regression
4. Lasso regression
5. Genetic programming
6. Neural network

## Model validation strategy

1. hold-out
2. k-fold
3. bootstrapping
